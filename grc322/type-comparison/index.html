        <h1>Futura vs. Mr Eaves Sans</h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Futura</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             <p>In 1927, Futura, a geometric sans-serif typeface was designed by Paul Renner in Germany in contribution to the New Frankfurt project, which was an affordable modernist housing project. The typeface was based on the geometric Bauhaus design style that had its boom between 1919 and 1933. The Bauhaus ideology was based on simple, modern, and functional geometry. Function over form resulted in a typeface that didn’t include unnecessary ornamental elements. Renner disliked apparently useless things such as abstract art, cinema, and dancing but enjoyed functional art like clean type. His goal was to fuse gothic and roman typefaces and break letters down into basic geometric forms. Unlike other sans-serif typefaces of its time, it had its design based on strokes that were near-even in weight, resulting in low contrast. The lowercase characters have tall ascenders that go over the height of uppercase characters. 
             
             Although the debut of Futura was received well globally, it was met with resistance in its native country by the Nazi party because of its more modern type anatomy. The Nazi party preferred traditional blackletter type; however, they would later follow the popular opinion and opt for a cleaner, more readable Roman style typeface. Futura has remained a widely used font since its creation in 1927 due to its timeless legibility. Its simple geometric shapes make it easy to read from a distance, which explains why transportation brands like Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Boeing, and NASA all use Futura on their dashboards. That also explains why it’s used in the brand identity of Crayola, Absolut, and HP, as well as movies by directors Stanley Kubrick and Wes Anderson. Its crowning achievement as a typeface is that it is used on a plaque left on the moon from the Apollo 11 mission, the first ever manned moon landing in 1969. It’s incredible how consistently popular Futura has remained — a true testament to the quality of its design.

			 <h3>Mr Eaves Sans</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

             <p>Mr Eaves Sans is a humanist sans-serif typeface designed by Zuzana Licko, a European-born but California-based graphic designer. It was created alongside its sibling typeface, Mr Eaves Modern. Mr Eaves Modern follows a more geometric sans approach while Mr Eaves Sans follows the original humanist approach that Mrs Eaves did. Both were published through the Emigre Type Library in 2009.

             Licko’s career creating typefaces began by creating pixel fonts. A bad experience in a calligraphy class caused her to try her hand at designing text on the brand new Apple Macintosh computer in 1985. According to Licko, the limited capabilities of the low-resolution computer screen and dot matrix printers caused her to have to design something unique. She made a name for herself showcasing her bitmap fonts in the publication Emigre magazine, which she expanded into Emigre Graphics and later Emigre Fonts. Licko began adapting traditional fonts into versions more compatible for on-screen and print use (Mrs Eaves is Licko’s updated Baskerville and Filosofia is based on Bodoni).

             One of the main concerns was to avoid creating a typeface that looked like it simply had its serifs cut off. So while it matches Mrs Eaves in weight, color, and armature, Mr Eaves stands as its own typeface with many unique characteristics. Some characters were rebalanced and shortened to add to the sans serif look, but certain characters still retain more flourish than typical sans serif fonts. Overall the font still has the generous letter spacing of Mrs Eaves, which gives it a warm friendly feeling.

			<h2>Comparison</h2>

            <figure>
				<img src="images/TypeComparison.jpg"
					 alt="The word 'Typed' written in both Futura and Mr Eaves Sans to compare their caplines, x-heights, and descent lines.">
				<figcaption>In general, Futura is larger in type size and x-height than Mr Eaves Sans. When comparing the two fonts side by side, Futura extends above the meanline and capline of Mr Eaves Sans. In general, looking at the angle of how the bowl connects to the stem of certain letters, like ‘p’ and 'd', one can distinguish Futura’s rounder appearance from Mr Eaves Sans’ shorter appearance.</figcaption>
