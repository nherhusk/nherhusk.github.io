                <h3><em>How Beautiful We Were</em></h3>
                <p>By Imbolo Mbue</p>
                <figure>

                <p>
                    Following her 2016 debut, <i>Behold the Dreamers,</i> Mbue’s sweeping and quietly devastating second novel begins in 1980 in the fictional African village of Kosawa, where representatives from an American oil company have come to meet with the locals, whose children are dying because of the environmental havoc (fallow fields, poisoned water) wreaked by its drilling and pipelines. This decades-spanning fable of power and corruption turns out to be something much less clear-cut than the familiar David-and-Goliath tale of a sociopathic corporation and the lives it steamrolls. Through the eyes of Kosawa’s citizens young and old, Mbue constructs a nuanced exploration of self-interest, of what it means to want in the age of capitalism and colonialism — these machines of malicious, insatiable wanting.

                <h3><em>Intimacies</em></h3>
                <p>By Katie Kitamura</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/intamacies.jpeg" alt="Book cover of Intimacies by Katie Kitamura" />
                </figure>
                <p>
                    In Kitamura’s fourth novel, an unnamed court translator in The Hague is tasked with intimately vanishing into the voices and stories of war criminals whom she alone can communicate with; falling meanwhile into a tumultuous entanglement with a man whose marriage may or may not be over for good. Kitamura’s sleek and spare prose elegantly breaks grammatical convention, mirroring the book’s concern with the bleeding lines between intimacies — especially between the sincere and the coercive. Like her previous novel, “A Separation,” “Intimacies” scrutinizes the knowability of those around us, not as an end in itself but as a lens on grand social issues from gentrification to colonialism to feminism. The path a life cuts through the world, this book seems to say, has its greatest significance in the effect it has on others.

                <h3><em>The Love Songs of W.E.B. Du Bois </em></h3>

                <p>
                    <i>The Love Songs of W.E.B. Du Bois,</i> the first novel by Jeffers, a celebrated poet, is many things at once: a moving coming-of-age saga, an examination of race and an excavation of American history. It cuts back and forth between the tale of Ailey Pearl Garfield, a Black girl growing up at the end of the 20th century, and the “songs” of her ancestors, Native Americans and enslaved African Americans who lived through the formation of the United States. As their stories converge, <i>Love Songs</i> creates an unforgettable portrait of Black life that reveals how the past still reverberates today.

                <h3><em>No One is Talking About This</em></h3> 
                <p>By Honorée Fanonne Jeffers</p>
                <figure>

                <p>
                Lockwood first found acclaim as a poet on the internet, with gloriously inventive and ribald verse — sexts elevated to virtuosity. In <em>Priestdaddy,</em> her indelible 2017 memoir about growing up in rectories across the Midwest presided over by her gun-loving, guitar-playing father, a Catholic priest, she called tweeting “an art form, like sculpture, or honking the national anthem under your armpit.” Here, in her first novel, she distills the pleasures and deprivations of life split between online and flesh-and-blood interactions, transfiguring the dissonance into art. The result is a book that reads like a prose poem, at once sublime, profane, intimate, philosophical, hilarious and, eventually, deeply moving.

                <h3><em>The Copenhagen Trilogy: Childhood; Youth; Dependency</em></h3> 
                <p>By Tove Ditlevsen. Translated by Tiina Nunnally and Michael Favala Goldman.</p>
                <figure>

                <p>
                Ditlevsen’s gorgeous memoirs, first published in Denmark in the 1960s and ’70s and collected here in a single volume, detail her hardscrabble upbringing, career path and merciless addictions: a powerful account of the struggle to reconcile art and life. She joined the working ranks at 14, became a renowned poet by her early 20s, and found herself, after two failed marriages, wedded to a psychopathic doctor and hopelessly dependent on opioids by her 30s. Yet for all the dramatic twists of her life, these books together project a stunning clarity, humor and candidness, casting light not just on the world’s harsh realities but on the inexplicable impulses of our secret selves.

                <h3><em>How the Word Is Passed: A Reckoning With the History of Slavery Across America</em></h3>

                </figure>
                <p>
                For this timely and thought-provoking book, Smith, a poet and journalist, toured sites key to the history of slavery and its present-day legacy, including Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello; Angola, the Louisiana State Penitentiary; and a Confederate cemetery. Interspersing interviews with the tourists, guides, activists and local historians he meets along the way with close readings of scholarship and poignant personal reflection, Smith holds up a mirror to America’s fraught relationship with its past, capturing a potent mixture of good intentions, earnest corrective, willful ignorance and blatant distortion.

                <h3><em>Invisible Child: Poverty, Survival and Hope in an American City</em></h3> 
                <p>By Andrea Elliott</p>

                <p>
                To expand on her acclaimed 2013 series for The Times about Dasani Coates, a homeless New York schoolgirl, and her family, Elliott spent years following her subjects in their daily lives, through shelters, schools, courtrooms and welfare offices. The book she has produced — intimately reported, elegantly written and suffused with the fierce love and savvy observations of Dasani and her mother — is a searing account of one family’s struggle with poverty, homelessness and addiction in a city and country that have failed to address these issues with efficacy or compassion.

                <h3><em>On Juneteenth</em></h3> 
                <p>By Annette Gordon-Reed</p>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p>
                This book weaves together history and memoir into a short volume that is insightful, touching and courageous. Exploring the racial and social complexities of Texas, her home state, Gordon-Reed asks readers to step back from the current heated debates and take a more nuanced look at history and the surprises it can offer. Such a perspective comes easy to her because she was a part of history — the first Black child to integrate her East Texas school. On several occasions, she found herself shunned by whites and Blacks alike, learning at an early age that breaking the color line can be threatening to both races.

                <h3><em>Red Comet: The Short Life and Blazing Art of Sylvia Plath</em></h3> 
                <p>By Heather Clark</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/redcomet.jpeg" alt="Book cover of Red Comet: The Short Life and Blazing Art of Sylvia Plath."/>

                <p>
                It’s daring to undertake a new biography of Plath, whose life, and death by suicide at 30 in 1963, have been thoroughly picked over by scholars. Yet this meticulously researched and, at more than 1,000 pages, unexpectedly riveting portrait is a monumental achievement. Determined to rescue the poet from posthumous caricature as a doomed madwoman and “reposition her as one of the most important American writers of the 20th century,” Clark, a professor of poetry in England, delivers a transporting account of a rare literary talent and the familial and intellectual milieu that both thwarted and encouraged her, enlivened throughout by quotations from Plath’s letters, diaries, poetry and prose.

                        <h3>Lasting Art: An Interview with Cole Swensen’s about Art in Time</h3>
                        <p>
                            <em>Art in Time</em> is a book that resists the idea of it ever becoming a “timeless work of art.” For poet, translator, and academic Cole Swensen, the very notion of a “timeless work of art” not only implies a refusal to engage with the present moment, but also exposes a fundamental problem in our viewership: our tendency of looking at rather than from within. In this collection of lyric essays, Swensen studies the work of twenty artists, all of whom have “found ways through landscape to become an active element in the view and its viewing.”.
