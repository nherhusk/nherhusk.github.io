                        <h3>The Top Books of 2021</h3>
                        <p>
                        Editors at the chose the best fiction and nonfiction titles this year. “A half-read book is a half-finished love affair,” wrote David Mitchell in Cloud Atlas. Below are the best books of 2021 read by the lib editors and staff—books that we tore through, books we dreamed about, books we pressed into our loved ones' hands and then stood back, twitchily watching them read.

                        <p>
                        There are some new books that make your hands feel heavy and your eyelids slam shut. These are not those books. These are must-read books that felt like addictions, perspective shifters, rich dessert. From Amazon best sellers to nonfiction books about the tradition of African American cooking to the book-club books that we actually finished, these are the novels to read before 2022 hits and a whole new slate of promising literary fiction hits.

                        <p>
                             <em>Art in Time</em> is a book that resists the idea of it ever becoming a timeless work of art. For poet, translator, and academic Cole Swensen, the very notion of a timeless work of art not only implies a refusal to engage with the present moment, but also exposes a fundamental problem in our viewership: our tendency of looking at rather than from within. In this collection of lyric essays, Swensen studies the work of twenty artists, all of whom have found ways through landscape to become an active element in the view and its viewing.

                            As an editor, I often think about what I consider to be the perfect book. It may be the book that you stay up all night reading (Toni Morrison’s Jazz), the book that you can’t imagine your thought processes without (George Orwell’s 1984; Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, Margaret Atwood’s Handmaid’s Tale), the book that changed your mind about a writer (Jonathan Franzen’s Freedom), the book that you’re ashamed you like, because it let you crawl into your own dark childhood, and maybe because you suspected it wasn’t literature (Pat Conroy’s Prince of Tides), or by the authors you read for yourself (C.D. Wright, Anne Carson, and, always, Morrison).

                        <h3>Daisy Jones & The Six</h3>
                        <p>
                            A gripping novel about the whirlwind rise of an iconic 1970s rock group and their beautiful lead singer, revealing the mystery behind their infamous break up. Everyone knows Daisy Jones & The Six, but nobody knows the real reason why they split at the absolute height of their popularity…until now.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Daisy is a girl coming of age in L.A. in the late sixties, sneaking into clubs on the Sunset Strip, sleeping with rock stars, and dreaming of singing at the Whisky a Go-Go. The sex and drugs are thrilling, but it’s the rock and roll she loves most. By the time she’s twenty, her voice is getting noticed, and she has the kind of heedless beauty that makes people do crazy things. Another band getting noticed is The Six, led by the brooding Billy Dunne. On the eve of their first tour, his girlfriend Camila finds out she’s pregnant, and with the pressure of impending fatherhood and fame, Billy goes a little wild on the road. Daisy and Billy cross paths when a producer realizes the key to supercharged success is to put the two together. What happens next will become the stuff of legend.

                        <h3>Everybody Loves Our Town: An Oral History of Grunge</h3>
                        <p>
                        Twenty years after the release of Nirvana’s landmark album Nevermind comes <em>Everybody Loves Our Town: An Oral History of Grunge,</em> the definitive word on the grunge era, straight from the mouths of those at the center of it all. In 1986, fledgling Seattle label C/Z Records released Deep Six, a compilation featuring a half-dozen local bands: Soundgarden, Green River, Melvins, Malfunkshun, the U-Men and Skin Yard. Though it sold miserably, the record made music history by documenting a burgeoning regional sound, the raw fusion of heavy metal and punk rock that we now know as grunge. But it wasn’t until five years later, with the seemingly overnight success of Nirvana’s Smells Like Teen Spirit, that grunge became a household word and Seattle ground zero for the nineties alternative-rock explosion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <em>Everybody Loves Our Town</em> captures the grunge era in the words of the musicians, producers, managers, record executives, video directors, photographers, journalists, publicists, club owners, roadies, scenesters and hangers-on who lived through it. The book tells the whole story: from the founding of the Deep Six bands to the worldwide success of grunge’s big four (Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and Alice in Chains); from the rise of Seattle’s cash-poor, hype-rich indie label Sub Pop to the major-label feeding frenzy that overtook the Pacific Northwest; from the simple joys of making noise at basement parties and tiny rock clubs to the tragic, lonely deaths of superstars Kurt Cobain and Layne Staley.

                        <h3>Crying in H Mart</h3>
                        <p>
                            An unflinching, powerful memoir about growing up Korean American, losing her mother, and forging her own identity. In this exquisite story of family, food, grief, and endurance, Michelle Zauner proves herself far more than a dazzling singer, songwriter, and guitarist. With humor and heart, she tells of growing up one of the few Asian American kids at her school in Eugene, Oregon; of struggling with her mother's particular, high expectations of her; of a painful adolescence; of treasured months spent in her grandmother's tiny apartment in Seoul, where she and her mother would bond, late at night, over heaping plates of food.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        As she grew up, moving to the East Coast for college, finding work in the restaurant industry, and performing gigs with her fledgling band--and meeting the man who would become her husband--her Koreanness began to feel ever more distant, even as she found the life she wanted to live. It was her mother's diagnosis of terminal cancer, when Michelle was twenty-five, that forced a reckoning with her identity and brought her to reclaim the gifts of taste, language, and history her mother had given her.Vivacious and plainspoken, lyrical and honest, Zauner's voice is as radiantly alive on the page as it is onstage. Rich with intimate anecdotes that will resonate widely, and complete with family photos, Crying in H Mart is a book to cherish, share, and reread.
